“bcrypt vs crypto in Node.js: Which Should You Use for Password Security?”

✅ Introduction

Why password security matters.

Common mistakes (e.g., storing plain text passwords, using simple hashing like MD5 or SHA256).

State the goal: Compare bcrypt and crypto for Node.js developers.

✅ 1. What is bcrypt?

Brief history (designed for password hashing, slow by design).

Features:

Built-in salting.

Adjustable cost factor (saltRounds).

Resistant to brute-force attacks due to computational cost.

Show a quick code snippet:

import bcrypt from "bcryptjs";

const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);

✅ 2. What is crypto?

Node.js built-in module.

Supports various hashing algorithms like sha256, sha512.

Designed for general cryptographic operations (signatures, encryption, checksums), NOT specialized for password hashing.

Show example of raw hashing (fast and bad for passwords):

import crypto from "crypto";

const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(password).digest("hex");


Explain why fast hashing is bad for passwords (attackers can try billions of guesses per second).

✅ 3. Why bcrypt is slow and why that’s good

Explain work factor / cost factor (saltRounds).

Why slowness = protection against brute force.

Compare how bcrypt automatically handles salting internally.

✅ 4. Can crypto be used safely for passwords?

Yes, but not with createHash().

Use PBKDF2 or scrypt:

PBKDF2: Uses many iterations.

scrypt: Memory-hard (even better).

Show PBKDF2 example:

crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, 100000, 64, "sha512", (err, derivedKey) => {
  console.log(derivedKey.toString("hex"));
});


Mention that PBKDF2 is standardized and widely used.

✅ 5. Performance Comparison

Raw crypto.createHash → microseconds (super fast → insecure).

bcrypt (10 rounds) → ~300ms per hash.

PBKDF2 (100k iterations) → ~250-300ms.

Add a simple table.

✅ 6. Which One Should You Use?

If hashing passwords for authentication → use bcrypt (or Argon2, or scrypt).

If hashing for non-password data (file integrity, tokens) → crypto (SHA256 or HMAC).

When crypto is acceptable for passwords → only if using PBKDF2 or scrypt with high iterations.

✅ 7. Best Practices

Always use unique salt per user (bcrypt does this automatically).

Use a slow algorithm for passwords.

Never store plain text or raw hashes.

Use environment variables for secrets (like JWT secret).

Don’t invent your own crypto (avoid “roll your own crypto”).

✅ Conclusion

Summarize:

bcrypt → great for passwords.

crypto → great for general hashing, but needs PBKDF2/scrypt for password security.

Suggest Argon2 as a modern alternative.

✅ Optional Sections

Real-world examples:

How big companies handle password hashing.

Common mistakes in Node.js projects:

Using crypto.createHash for passwords.

Using the same salt for all users.
